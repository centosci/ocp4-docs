This doc is intended to document the processes of upgrading the openshift cluster. It is an initiative of the CentOS CI Infrastructure team in CPE. \
End result: console.apps.ci.centos.org is pointed to OCP 4.x cluster and we have migrated all the projects under current version (3.6) to the newly deployed (4.4) cluster.
